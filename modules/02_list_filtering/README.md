# Module 02: List Filtering 01

### Scenario

We are presented with a list of G20 members and a list of G7 members. We need to produce a third list consisting of the "G13"; G20 members which are not members of the G7.

### Goal

Create a new local value, `local.g13`, which is a list containing all of the values within `local.g20` that *do not* appear in `local.g7`.
