# Module 02: List Filtering 01

### Scenario

To go along with our list of G20 nations we are given a map containing GDP data from December 2022 (Billion USD). We would like to find out which countries have a GDP over a given threshold.

### Goal

Create a new local value, `local.gdp_over_threshold`, which will result in a list of all nations whose GDP exceeds the value of `local.threshold`; 1 trillion USD (1000 billion).
