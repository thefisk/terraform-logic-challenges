# Module 02: List Filtering 01

### Scenario

Ah! The requirements have changed at the 11th hour. This never happens. Right? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Well, now we have been provided with an upper limit so we need to find countries whose GDP is more than 1 trillion, but less than 3 trillion.

### Goal

Create a new local value, `local.gdp_in range`, which will result in a list of all nations whose GDP exceeds the value of `local.mimimum`, but is also under the value provided oin `local.maximum`.
