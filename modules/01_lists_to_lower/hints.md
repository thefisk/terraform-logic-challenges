## Hints

This first module will need to make use of the `lower()` [function](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/lower) for sure but is also an introduction to Terraform's `for` [logic](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/for) (not to be confused with `for_each`)
